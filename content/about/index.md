Hello! My name is Nikolai Simonov, and I’m a software engineer. For about six years, I have been developing mobile applications. My current employer is [Harman][harman] company. Currently, I’m mostly developing applications for GM’s head units. Also, I teach programming courses inside a company.

I was giving a [presentation][ar-pres] about Augmented Reality at [MERA's meetup][mera-ar-meetup].

For now, I'm highly interested in development with the [Flutter.io][flutter-io] framework, and at free time I am developing a [library][dart-tags] for parsing ID3 tags in pure dart language.

I love the design! In my youth, I graduated from the school of art. Also sometime in the past, I worked as a designer in polygraphic, as photo designer, and web designer.
